              <h3> Week 12 Diary Entry </h3>
              <p><strong>Storyboard: </strong><br>
                My storyboard has shifted to accomidate more of the first time viewers or people who have not watched the show.
                Therefore, the datastory now would focus more on the introduction of what Survivor is and the general trends of the game rather than indepth analysis of the gameplay.<br>
                

                <br>


                
                 <strong>Errors and challenges: </strong><br><br>

                 I am currently sturggling to find methods to attach multiple .csv files using d3.js to create different maps and animations.

              <h3> Week 11 Diary Entry </h3>
              <p><strong>The data of my project and the visualizations I plan to use</strong><br><br>
                  The data I will be using is primiarly from <a href="https://github.com/doehm/survivoR"> this github page. </a> The data is in .rda format and I will using RStudio to convert them into .csv files as I am not experienced in handling R files. 
                  This is done through the use of write.csv() command in RStudio that I learnt through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MIh4ZrgeKg">this video</a>.<br>
                  Additional data, if needed, would be retrived and keyed in manually from the <a href="https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page"> Survivor Wiki Page</a>.<br><br>
                  To start the data story off, I would be attempting to use animation to show the general flow of the gameplay through <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/animations/">Plotly Animations</a><br>
                  <br>
                  The data for where the show has been filmed is not in the R data so I will be using the Survivor wiki for the data. In terms of visualisations, I will be using <a href="https://plotly.com/javascript/choropleth-maps/"> plotly choropleth maps </a>
                  to show both the locations of where the show has filmed (World Map) and where the contestants are from (US's map). <br><br>
                  In terms of the viewership and rating of the show, I will primiarly be using viewers.rda for my data source (which is then converted to viewers.csv).
                  For visualisations of data for the viewership and rating, I will first make 2 line graphs showcasing the change in viewership with the change in show's rating over the period of the entire run of the show.
                  <br><br>
                  Then, the trends of the shows will be similarly be shown through simple bar and line charts, possibly through plotly.
                  <br><br>
                  Afterwards, episodes and seasons with the highest ratings will be highlighted as a way to guide the new viewer to choose which season to watch first. This is done through the use of barcharts. 
                  I plan to add custom events to each barchart that will give a synopsis of the episode / season but I am struggling to find a method for it through chart.js so I might shift this over to plotly if need be. <br><br>
                  I also want to highlight Season 40 of the show : Winners at War, as it is the season with all winners of previous seasons playing so I want to use an interactive method to showcase the relationship between those winners and the seasons they have played together in.
                  For the visualisation of this component, I found a method called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2-sgZh49dQ">force directed graph </a>that I feel would be suitable for this.  <br><br>



                
                 <strong>Errors and challenges: </strong><br><br>
                 In terms of the plotly map, I am struggling to put in the data according to what the plotly website has shown as I don't know how to upload the .csv files and hence retrive using d3.csv method.
                 <br><br>
                 I am also still struggling to make my line graph on Viewership vs Rating to have mixed y axis.
                 <br>
                 The force directed graph also seems to be qutie complex so I would need to dedicate quite a bit of time for that after I learn d3.js in week 12.

                <h3> 5 Questions </h3> 
                <p> 
                  <strong>What is your project about?</strong><br>
                  US version of Survivor Reality TV competition<br><br>
                  
                  <strong>What is the data you plan to use?</strong><br>
                  The show's ratings / viewership, demographics
                 <a href="https://github.com/doehm/survivoR"> LINK </a><br><br>     
                  
                 <strong> What is the question you plan to answer?</strong><br> 
                  Why should I watch the show and where should I start watching<br><br>  
                  
                  <strong> Why is this an important question?</strong><br> 
                  Survivor is one of the longest running reality TV show that have lasted for 23 years (and counting).<br> 
                  Survivor's ratings have always been high on average but the viewership is on a decline, so it is important to introduce new viewers to the show.<br> 
                  Survivor does a good job at representation through a diverse cast so it carries a lot of important stories and narrativies that need to be seen.<br><br> 
                  
                  
                  <strong> Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question?</strong><br> 
                  I am using multiple data files but for viewers.csv, I am using labels of Seasons, Average imdb_rating and viewers number. Since the data includes Australian and South African version of the show, I will be filtering those data out. <br>
                  In terms of the castaways.csv, I will be using the order of their elimination and then will be filtering out the Australian and South African version of the show.<br>
                    
                </p>
                <br>

              <h3> Changes to Datastory Flow / Concept </h3> 
              <p> The focus and flow of the datastory of Week 9 felt a bit all over the place so I have decided to narrow the datastroy down for mainly new viewers or people curious about survivor. 
                  The new flow of the datastory would be <br>
                  <br>1. Introduction to what Survivor is 
                  <br>2. Brief introduction about where it have been filmed and where the contestants are mostly from - maps
                  <br>3. Viewership & Rating -> which season to watch
                  <br>4. Why you should watch -> Demographic & Representation
                  
              </p><br>

              <h3> Changes / Update Summary </h3> 
              <p> 
                1. Overall change of sequence of the datastory, with omission of some deeper gameplay elements to focus more on the new viewers.<br><br>
                2. Added episodes rating and seasons to watch chart<br><br>
              </p><br>
           
              <h3> Challenges </h3> 
              <p> 
                1. For my charts, I want to put a custom tooltip that will show more than just the data, however, I am struggling to find resources to make the custom toolbar.<br><br>
                2. For my linechart, I want to do mixed y axis (1 for rating and another for viewership since they are different types of data) but I am struggling to make it work.<br><br>
                3. For my maps, I am struggling to find the correct method to add in maps with tooltips and links.
                4. In terms of my overall datastory, I feel that I might be lacking a bit of depth? However, I am struggling to come up with more ways to analyse the data.<br><br>
