                <h3> 5 Questions </h3> 
                <p> 
                  <strong>What is your project about?</strong><br>
                  US version of Survivor Reality TV competition<br><br>
                  
                  <strong>What is the data you plan to use?</strong><br>
                  The show's ratings / viewership, demographics
                 <a href="https://github.com/doehm/survivoR"> LINK </a><br><br>     
                  
                 <strong> What is the question you plan to answer?</strong><br> 
                  Why should I watch the show and where should I start watching<br><br>  
                  
                  <strong> Why is this an important question?</strong><br> 
                  Survivor is one of the longest running reality TV show that have lasted for 23 years (and counting).<br> 
                  Survivor's ratings have always been high on average but the viewership is on a decline, so it is important to introduce new viewers to the show.<br> 
                  Survivor does a good job at representation through a diverse cast so it carries a lot of important stories and narrativies that need to be seen.<br><br> 
                  
                  
                  <strong> Which rows and columns of the dataset do you plan to use, to answer this question?</strong><br> 
                  I am using multiple data files but for viewers.csv, I am using labels of Seasons, Average imdb_rating and viewers number. Since the data includes Australian and South African version of the show, I will be filtering those data out. <br>
                  In terms of the castaways.csv, I will be using the order of their elimination and then will be filtering out the Australian and South African version of the show.<br>
                    
                </p>
                <br>

              <h3> Changes to Datastory Flow / Concept </h3> 
              <p> The focus and flow of the datastory of Week 9 felt a bit all over the place so I have decided to narrow the datastroy down for mainly new viewers or people curious about survivor. 
                  The new flow of the datastory would be <br>
                  <br>1. Introduction to what Survivor is 
                  <br>2. Brief introduction about where it have been filmed and where the contestants are mostly from - maps
                  <br>3. Viewership & Rating -> which season to watch
                  <br>4. Why you should watch -> Demographic & Representation
                  
              </p><br>

              <h3> Changes / Update Summary </h3> 
              <p> 
                1. Overall change of sequence of the datastory, with omission of some deeper gameplay elements to focus more on the new viewers.<br><br>
                2. Added episodes rating and seasons to watch chart<br><br>
              </p><br>
           
              <h3> Challenges </h3> 
              <p> 
                1. For my charts, I want to put a custom tooltip that will show more than just the data, however, I am struggling to find resources to make the custom toolbar.<br><br>
                2. For my linechart, I want to do mixed y axis (1 for rating and another for viewership since they are different types of data) but I am struggling to make it work.<br><br>
                3. For my maps, I am struggling to find the correct method to add in maps with tooltips and links.
                4. In terms of my overall datastory, I feel that I might be lacking a bit of depth? However, I am struggling to come up with more ways to analyse the data.<br><br>
