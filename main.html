                  Survivor is a reality TV show that puts a group of strangers in a remote area where they are required to cater for their own needs in terms of food, fire, and shelter. For prizes and immunity from elimination, 
                  contestants participate in activities that test their physical prowess, such as running and swimming, or their mental prowess, such as puzzles and endurance trials. 
                  The participants are gradually eliminated from the game as they are voted off by the other players, and when only one is left, that person is dubbed the "Sole Survivor" and wins the $1,000,000 grand prize.<br><br>
                  For this datastory, the data used will be of the US version of the show.

                <p>The average placing stats show the average position of male or female per season. Therefore, the higher number means the earlier elimination </p>
                <p>Given the physical nature of the show, there is an assumption that male will do better on the show. From the statsitics however, it is shown that both male and female are on average, placed evenly, with
                  the overall average median having only a 0.4 difference. However, there are seasons such as Season 18 or 33 where a certain sex does perfom much better than the other. This could be due to having all male 
                  or all female alliance, such as the iconic <a href=https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Widow_Brigade > Black Widow Brigade </a>in Survivor 16: Micronesia.

            <p>Survivor started out less diverse with less POC players but as the show progress, it has casted a much more diverse cast.<br>
              <br>However, an anomaly to note is that of Season 13 and 14, which had the concept of splitting the tribes by race. This was a controversial decision as it made it seem like it was a "Race War" (Blickley, 2020) and hence Season 14 did not implement this concept, although it still had the diverse cast. <br>
              <br>The increase in the diversity of cast could also be attributed to the CBS diversity pledge (Ross, 2022) after the tradgedies of George Floyd and Beronna Taylor in 2020. Survivor after the Covid pandemic has then entered a new era - starting from S41 - that promise to be more diverse than ever.
